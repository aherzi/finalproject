This project taught me how to assemble a robot from scratch using 3d printed parts,5 servo motors, an ultrasonic sensor,jumper wires, screws, spacers, and super glue. I faced numerous challenges when building this project, from short-circuited batteries to incorrect servo motors and stripped gear calibrations. What I found most interesting in this project was the ability to customize the robot's movements by adjusting the angle of the legs and feet of the servo motors. Overall this project gave me a good understanding of robotics as it combines hardware and software elements. I plan to upgrade this robot to do more complex movements in the future.
