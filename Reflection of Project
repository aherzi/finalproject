This project taught me how to assemble a robot from scratch using 3d printed parts,5 servo motors, an ultrasonic sensor,jumper wires,screw, spacers, and super glue. I faced numerous challeneges when building this project from short circuted batteries to incorrect calibertation of servo motors and stripped gear. What I found most interesting in this project was having the ability customize the robots by adjusting the leg and feet seervo motors angles. Overall this project gave me a good understanding of robotics as it combines both hardware and software elements. I plan to upgrade this rorobt to do more complex movements.
