This project taught me how to assemble a robot from scratch using 3d printed parts,5 servo motors, an ultrasonic sensor, jumper wires, screws, spacers, and super glue. I faced numerous challenges when building this project, from short-circuited batteries to incorrect servo motors and stripped gear calibrations. What I found most interesting was the software portion of this project. Arduino's IDE allowed me to customize the robot's movements by adjusting the angle of the legs and feet of the servo motors. Although C++ has a different syntax than Python, I found  similarities in the languages such as creating functions, loops, operators, and importing libraries. Overall this project gave me a good understanding of robotics as it combines hardware and software elements. I plan to upgrade this robot to do more complex movements.
