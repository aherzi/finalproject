# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Biped Catbot (Biped because it will be walking on two legs instead of four)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will be making a two-legged robot to make various movements

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This project will consist of an Arduino nano, five servos(two for each leg and one for the head), an ultrasonic sensor,7.v battery, and some jumper wires. I will then need to use a PCB board to connect the components to allow a direct flow of electricity. I plan on soldering the parts to the PCB board to create a permanent bond. For the software, I will be using Arduino's built-in programming language which uses a variant of C++.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome of this final project for me is based on dedicated time, a positive attitude, and a willingness to learn and grow. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome for the final project is for me to reach the point of satisfaction with my work even if my goals weren't met.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The best outcome for my final project is if all my initial goals were met before the deadline. I hope to make the catbot move to various coordinates and act accordingly based on what objects are in its pathway.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next step is to install the hardware by connecting all parts to PCB board. I will then need to research how to solder properly. For the software, I will need to understand the syntax of Arduino's variant of C++.
